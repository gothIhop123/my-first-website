                    <p>The rain had stopped, but the city still smelled like soft ozone and jasmine. Neon lights
                        reflected off the wet pavement of Tundratown and slid into the warm glow of Sahara Square. Judy
                        Hopps tucked her long ears beneath a hood and pushed her way through a crowd of evening
                        commuters, her badge glinting like a tiny moon in the dim light. She had promised one more stop
                        on her way home — a new lead, a tip that wasn't much more than a whisper, but a whisper she
                        couldn't ignore.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>Nick Wilde waited beneath the awning of a corner café, leaning on the counter with his usual,
                        casual grin. He wore a thin scarf tonight and had a half-drunk cup of something smoky steaming
                        at his side. The fox watched Judy with a mixture of amusement and something softer she rarely
                        allowed him to see.</p>


                    <p>"Late again?" he drawled as she drew near. "You're starting to make this a habit, Officer Hopps."
                        Judy huffed. "Lead's cold, but it's still a lead. Besides— I could ask the same of you. You look
                        suspiciously well-rested for a guy who's supposed to be meeting a smuggler."
                        "Guilty as charged," Nick said, tipping an invisible hat. "But I was thinking more of pastries
                        than contraband."
                    </p>

                <section class="chapter">
                    <p>They walked together through a narrower lane that smelled faintly of cardamom and engine oil.
                        Judy's determination felt less like iron in her ribs and more like a warm thread when Nick fell
                        into step at her side. The case — if it could be called that — had been small: missing
                        deliveries from a food co-op, a pattern in the city that stubbornly refused to become a
                        headline. For Judy it was the sort of thing she lived for; for Nick it was the sort of puzzle
                        that made him want to smile and ask, "What if?"</p>


                    <p>"The camera near the depot went fuzzy at 23:12," Judy said, eyes scanning a wall where posters
                        curled. "Then a delivery truck that was supposed to be there wasn't. Nothing dramatic,
                        just...odd."</p>


                    <p>"Someone with a good reason to keep it quiet," Nick offered. "Or someone who's very, very
                        careful."
                        "Either way," Judy said, "we'll find out."
                    </p>
                </section>


                <section class="chapter">
                    <p>They climbed a narrow staircase that led to a rooftop garden dotted with potted ferns and strings
                        of old bulbs. The city unfurled beneath them like a map stitched in glass and lamplight. From
                        here they could see the depot — a squat building with a neat loading bay — and the shadow of a
                        delivery truck leisurely parked under a streetlamp. Nick raised an eyebrow.</p>


                    <p>"Want to stake it out?" Judy whispered.
                        "Oh, thrilling," Nick said, but he made no move to leave. He set his cup down and gestured for
                        Judy to sit on an overturned crate next to him. "You take the star role, Officer Hopps. I
                        provide decadent commentary."
                    </p>


                    <p>They waited.</p>
                </section>


                <section class="chapter">
                    <p>At first, nothing happened — only the soft murmur of traffic and a stray cat slipping shadows.
                        Then, as the city clock chimed midnight, a figure moved at the depot's side: a large silhouette,
                        careful and sure. Two others followed. Watching through a pair of borrowed binoculars, Judy's
                        nose twitched the way it did when a clue clicked into place.</p>


                    <p>"They're unloading something small," she whispered. "Crates. Maybe foodstuffs?"
                        Nick leaned in, squinting. "Maybe they're trying to do it without cameras noticing."
                    </p>


                    <p>Judy's mind started to map the scene — angles, exits, the way the three moved in rhythm. She
                        could feel the old adrenaline, the same thrill that had made her take on the city in the first
                        place. She reached for her radio and then paused. For a moment she allowed the night to exist
                        without orders, without sirens. Nick watched her, and for the first time in a long stretch of
                        cases and coffee-fueled nights, she felt like she wasn't alone in carrying the weight of a
                        missing clue.</p>
                </section>


                <section class="chapter">
                    <p>They moved in, not with sirens but with quiet steps and shared purpose. The trio of shadowy
                        figures hadn't expected an audience. Judy slipped from the alley like a whisper, Nick trailing,
                        his tail low and careful. The crates were humble — boxes labeled with the co-op logo. When one
                        crate opened the scent of dried herbs swooped out, innocent and domestic. The middle crate,
                        however, contained a cache of small devices — trackers and modules, not the sort of thing you'd
                        expect in a food delivery.</p>


                    <p>"Why hide trackers in food crates?" Nick muttered. "That's... oddly clever."
                        "They're using the deliveries to map routes — not to steal the goods, but to map stops," Judy
                        said. "Someone's building a picture of the network."
                    </p>


                    <p>As they moved closer, the three men turned, startled. Judy held up her badge slowly. "ZPD," she
                        said, voice steady. "We need to ask some questions."
                </section>


                <section class="chapter">
                    <p>The confrontation was brisk. It turned out the men were contractors hired by a logistics company
                        working for a larger pack-runner — a broker who'd been offering route optimization to the bigger
                        delivery firms. Their intent had never been malicious: the trackers were there to test
                        efficiency. But in the wrong hands, Judy knew, a map could become a blueprint.</p>


                    <p>They untangled the misunderstanding with paperwork and statements, and the men left with their
                        dignity slightly bruised but cooperation intact. The broker, when traced, was a different story.
                        He owed money to a syndicate that loved routes and hated witnesses. Nick raised a brow and
                        pocketed a small, folded business card the men had left behind — an address, a safehouse maybe,
                        or the next piece of the puzzle. He passed it to Judy with the smile that was equal parts
                        apology and invitation.</p>


                    <p>"You planning to arrest him now, or later?" he asked.
                        Judy set her jaw. "Now, Nick."
                    </p>
                </section>


                <section class="chapter">
                    <p>Their trip to the broker's office took them across neighborhoods they knew well — the places
                        where the city hummed in different registers. By the time they reached the address, night had
                        softened into pre-dawn. The broker's office smelled of cheap coffee and old paper. He was
                        surprised, flustered, and ultimately led quietly into cuffs. It wasn't glamorous, but it was
                        right.</p>


                    <p>On the walk home, the sky blushed with the first light. Judy felt it: the small, clean
                        satisfaction of having done good work. Nick nudged her shoulder gently. "You ever think about
                        how small moments like this add up?" he asked.
                        She considered it. "All the time. But it's better when you don't have to carry them alone."
                    </p>


                    <p>Nick's grin softened into something real. "Good. Because I don't plan on letting you."
